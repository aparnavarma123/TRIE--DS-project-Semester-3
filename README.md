# TRIE--DS-project-Semester-3
 Autocomplete-DS-project- Data Structure project using trie as a data structure which suggests words based on incomplete words provided 

We are given a Trie with a set of strings stored in it. Now the user types in a prefix of his search query, we need to give him all recommendations to auto-complete his query based on the strings stored in the Trie.

For example if the Trie store {“abc”, “abcd”, “aa”, “abbbaba”} and the User types in “ab” then he must be shown {“abc”, “abcd”, “abbbaba”}.
